## 🎯 **Key Improvements Over Original**

| Feature | Original MCP | New Implementation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Event CRUD | ✅ Basic | ✅ **Enhanced** |
| Calendar Management | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ **Full Support** |
| Smart Scheduling | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ **Available** |
| Batch Operations | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ **Supported** |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ **Comprehensive** |
| Retry Logic | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ **Automatic** |
| RESTful APIs | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ **Complete Set** |
| Documentation | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ **Comprehensive** |

## 🔧 **How to Use**

### 1. **Authentication Setup** (One-time)
```bash
cd backend/calendar/mcp
node auth.js
```

### 2. **Test All Features**
```bash
cd backend
node test-all-calendar-features.js
```

### 3. **Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 4. **Use in Frontend**
All endpoints are now available at `/calendar/*` with proper authentication.

### 5. **Use in Chat**
Chat integration now supports all calendar operations:
- "What are my events today?" → Lists today's events
- "Find my meeting with John" → Searches events  
- "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3pm" → Creates event
- "Move my 6pm meeting to 7pm" → Updates event
- "Cancel my evening meeting" → Deletes event
- "When am I free tomorrow?" → Checks availability
- "Show my calendars" → Lists calendars
