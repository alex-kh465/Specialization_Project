# Fixes Applied for Calendar & Chat Issues

## Issues Addressed

### 1. AI Chat Generic Response Issue
**Problem**: AI chat was giving generic "Can you please rephrase your request?" response for calendar scheduling commands.

**Root Cause**: The regex patterns for extracting JSON calendar operations from AI responses were not robust enough, causing parsing failures.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced JSON parsing with multiple regex patterns in `/ai/chat` endpoint
- Added fallback parsing for malformed JSON
- Improved JSON cleaning and validation
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Created debug endpoint `/ai/debug-calendar` for testing without AI API calls

### 2. Frontend Calendar Connection UI Issue  
**Problem**: Frontend shows "connection is established" toast notification but UI doesn't update to show "Connected" state.

**Root Cause**: State management and response format handling in the React component wasn't robust enough.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `checkAuthStatus()` function with more robust response format detection
- Improved state persistence with localStorage caching
- Added better error handling and logging
- Enhanced connection state update logic
- Added delayed re-verification to ensure UI updates properly

## Files Modified

### Backend (`backend/index.js`)
1. **Enhanced JSON parsing logic** in `/ai/chat` endpoint:
   - Multiple regex patterns for JSON extraction
   - JSON cleaning and validation
   - Better error handling for malformed responses

2. **Added debug endpoint** `/ai/debug-calendar`:
   - Simulates AI responses for testing
   - Tests calendar operation parsing without AI API calls
   - Uses same parsing logic as real AI endpoint

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/calendar/GoogleCalendarIntegration.tsx`)
1. **Improved connection state management**:
   - Enhanced response format detection
   - Better localStorage persistence
   - More robust error handling
   - Delayed verification for UI updates

2. **Better logging and debugging**:
   - Console logs for connection status checks
   - Detailed response format analysis
   - State change tracking

## Testing

### New Test Script (`backend/test-fixes.js`)
Comprehensive test script that verifies:
- Calendar connection status
- Calendar setup and authentication
- Calendar data fetching
- Debug chat functionality (without AI)
- Real AI chat functionality
- Direct event creation

### How to Test

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   node test-fixes.js
   ```

3. **Test the frontend**:
   - Open the frontend application
   - Navigate to the Calendar page
   - Try connecting Google Calendar
   - Verify UI updates after connection
   - Test AI chat with calendar commands

## Expected Results

### AI Chat Improvements
- Calendar scheduling commands should now be parsed correctly
- JSON operations should be extracted properly
- Less generic "rephrase" responses
- Better calendar operation execution

### Frontend Calendar Connection
- UI should update immediately after successful connection
- "Connected" state should persist across page refreshes
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Robust handling of different response formats

## Debug Commands for Testing

### Test Calendar Connection
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/calendar/mcp/calendars \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Test AI Chat (Debug)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ai/debug-calendar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message": "schedule a meeting tomorrow"}'
```

### Test Calendar Setup
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/calendar/mcp/setup-auth \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Notes

1. **Token Expiration**: Update the `TEST_TOKEN` in `test-fixes.js` with a fresh JWT token if tests fail with 401 errors.

2. **MCP Server**: Ensure the MCP Calendar server is built and OAuth credentials are properly configured.

3. **Environment Variables**: Check that `GROQ_API_KEY` and other required environment variables are set for AI functionality.

4. **Browser Console**: Check browser developer console for detailed logs when testing frontend calendar connection.

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with actual usage scenarios
2. Monitor logs for any remaining parsing issues
3. Consider adding more robust error recovery mechanisms
4. Implement automatic token refresh for better user experience
